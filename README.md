# iMac 21.5" Review

## The Monitor
The monitor of iMac 21.5" is almost next
to perfection. I really love the way 
they design it as simple as possible.

The bezel is another issue for the others
who don't truly understand. It's neglible
for that size and it actually helps you
focus because you think that it's not large
enough.

## The Retina Display
The retina display is really an awesome 
experience, I covered that here:

<sample>
  
Your eyes wont have the usual fatigue
and it's almost next to natural view
because you don't see the pixels.

## The Display Scaling
The display scaling is really great.
The way things there are scaled are exactly
the size your brain will expect.

Windows scaling is not that much for 
the larger screen but iMac just nailed it. 

## The Built-In Camera & Speaker 

## The Virtual Desktop (Spaces)

## The Performance
