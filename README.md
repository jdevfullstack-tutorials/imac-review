# iMac 21.5" Review
Take note, I am not in any way related to
Apple Company and I am not promoting this
product.

## The Monitor
The monitor of the iMac 21.5" is almost next
to perfection. I really love the way 
they designed it as simple as possible.

The bezel is an issue for the others
who don't truly understand. It's negligible
for that size and it actually helps you
focus because you think that it's not 
that large enough.

## The Retina Display
The retina display is really an awesome 
experience, I covered that here:

Your eyes won't have the usual fatigue
and it's almost next to natural view
because you don't see the pixels.

The only downside is that, since 4k is 
so dense, the things on the screen will appear 
smaller when your eyes are used to 1080p displays.
But the only trick here is the viewing
distance. I mentioned that in my 
[display](https://github.com/xdvrx1/display-resolution-review)
review.  

## The Display Scaling
The display scaling is really great.
The way things were scaled are exactly
the size you expect.

Windows scaling is not that much for 
the larger screen but iMac just nailed it.

As you can see here, everything is fine, things 
are proportional. In Windows 10, even in Chrome
the scaling is not that good even just for a 27"
external monitor.

I feel like this is a very big mobile phone
and the scaling is just exactly like that.

And if you noticed that, I am not making it full
screen just to save the landscape view. I still 
want to see the Desktop background too.
If you have the full screen, most spaces will
be just white just to fill the page, so
it's an overkill.

## The Built-In Camera & Speaker 
The built-in speaker is an excellent one
in terms of sound quality. It's
also loud enough that you don't need an external
speaker.

For the built-in camera, compared to others,
it's not that good. The auto-adjust feature
does not seem to benefit, if there is
any at all.
Say, for example, your background is brighter
than your front, 
it will auto-adjust in such a way that your
face is too dim. That's not good. You need
extra lighting for your face.

## The Virtual Desktop (Spaces)
The Virtual Desktop is another great built-in
app of iMac. As a productivity machine,
you will be dealing with a lot of windows
and the Spaces app will enable you to
have several setups.

Now, here is the thing: you must set up
everything and make sure you select:
`Reopen windows when logging back in`. This way,
you don't need to do the same thing every time
you shut it down. This feature is, by default,
missing in Windows.

## The Performance

Since Apple also is responsible for the hardware
of their products, they are making sure they
install everything at optimum performance.

For example, the iMac that I'm using is 
just an i3 processor yet the performance
is really excellent. I did not experience
lagging for so many Google Chrome tabs
opened at the same time. They are also
scattered for 9 virtual desktops and the
performance is still excellent.

The iMac that I'm using is using the Fusion Drive
technology, not purely SSD. But still, for me,
that's sufficient enough for the overall performance.
Now, of course the new models are already SSD
so you get that speed for an SSD.

Take note, if you are quite confused, computers
need a disk so that all the data that should
be saved will be kept before shut down.
An Operating System, just like macOS or Windows
OS, contains a lot of files. These files should
be saved to a disk not on the memory because the
memory is volatile.

Now, the difference between the hard disk and 
Solid State Drive is that the other one
has the literal moving arm so it is slower
compared to the SSD, which is like the flash
drive. It does not have the moving arm
so data will be retrieved faster than the 
hard disk. 

But several technologies implemented hybrids
like the Fusion Drive. SSD is costly
so the tendency is to mix
both technology for performance, so
buyers still saved some money.
