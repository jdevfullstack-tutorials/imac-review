# iMac 21.5" Review

## The Monitor
The monitor of iMac 21.5" is almost next
to perfection. I really love the way 
they design it as simple as possible.

The bezel is another issue for the others
who don't truly understand. It's neglible
for that size and it actually helps you
focus because you think that it's not large
enough.

## The Retina Display
The retina display is really an awesome 
experience, I covered that here:

<sample>
  
Your eyes wont have the usual fatigue
and it's almost next to natural view
because you don't see the pixels.

## The Display Scaling
The display scaling is really great.
The way things there are scaled are exactly
the size your brain will expect.

Windows scaling is not that much for 
the larger screen but iMac just nailed it. 

## The Built-In Camera & Speaker 
The built-in speaker is an excellent one
in terms of sound quality. It's
also loud enough that you don't need an external
speaker.

For the built-in camera, compared to others,
it's not that good. They added functionalities
that sometimes make it to adjust automatically.
Say, for example, your background is brighter
than your in front of you, it will be really
it will auto-adjust in such a way that your
face is too dim. That's not good. You need
extra lighting for your face.

## The Virtual Desktop (Spaces)
The Virtual Desktop is another great built-in
app of iMac. As productivity machine,
you will be dealing with a lot of Windows
and the spaces provided will enable you to
have several setups.

Now, here is the thing: you must set up
everything and make sure you select:
`Reopen Windows at the next login`. This way,
you don't need to do the same thing everytime
you shut it down. This feauture is missing in Windows.

## The Performance
Since Apple also is responsible for the hardware
of their products, they are making sure they
install everything at optimum performance.

For example, the iMac that I'm using is 
just an i3 processor yet the performance
is really excellent. I did not experience
lagging for so many Google Chrome tabs
opened at the same time.
