# iMac 21.5" Review

## The Monitor
The monitor of iMac 21.5" is almost next
to perfection. I really love the way 
they design it as simple as possible.

The bezel is another issue for the others
who don't truly understand. It's neglible
for that size and it actually helps you
focus because you think that it's not large
enough.
